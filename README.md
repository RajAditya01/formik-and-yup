# Formik
Formik is a popular React library that simplifies the process of managing forms in React applications. It provides a set of utilities and components to handle form state, form submission, form validation, and error handling. Formik aims to reduce the boilerplate code associated with form management, making it easier to build and maintain forms in React.

### Key features of Formik include:

Form State Management: Formik manages the state of your form components, including values, touched fields, and form submission status.

Form Submission: It simplifies form submission by providing a straightforward onSubmit prop that allows you to define the logic for handling form submissions.

Form Validation: While Formik itself doesn't include validation, it seamlessly integrates with validation libraries like Yup to enable schema-based form validation.

Field Components: Formik provides Field components that can be used to encapsulate form fields, handling their state and interaction with the form.

Formik Context: The library uses React's context to manage the form state across components, making it easy to access and update form values.

# Yup
Yup is a JavaScript object schema validation library. It allows you to define a schema for your data and validate that data against the schema. Yup is commonly used in combination with form libraries, such as Formik, to enforce validation rules on form fields.

### Key features of Yup include:

Schema Definition: You can define a schema using Yup's API, specifying the shape and validation rules for your data.

Chainable API: Yup provides a chainable API for building validation rules in a fluent manner, making it easy to express complex validation logic.

Asynchronous Validation: Yup supports asynchronous validation, allowing you to perform asynchronous tasks (e.g., API calls) as part of your validation process.

Custom Validation Messages: You can customize error messages for each validation rule, providing meaningful feedback to users.
